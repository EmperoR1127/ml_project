\textbf{Project proposal}
\begin{itemize}
\item Project title: A unique way to improve road safety: car accident analysis by machine learning
\item Project type: application oriented
\item Name of group numbers:
\item Description of dataset: UK 2016 Road Safety Data, provided by UK Department for Transport, available at \url{https://www.kaggle.com/bluehorseshoe/uk-2016-road-safety-data}

\item Project description: By training machine learning models, the project aims to generalize hidden patterns of thousands of car accident in UK, i.e. what are common features of most accidents, what are the main causes of the accident and what kinds of person might lead to accident. Hence, we can provide distinctive solutions to local authorities to, in some way, ameliorate the road safety in the near future.
\item Statement: I hereby certify I will not use
these dataset(s) and algorithm(s) in any other courses, past, present or future. I understand that
submitting overlapping material for more than one course is not allowed. This work is also not
part of my thesis or capstone project research. I understand that any such action on my part will
lead to a grade of INC being awarded for CSI5155 and may lead to academic sanctions imposed
by the faculty of Engineering.
\end{itemize}
